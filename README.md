# Overview
This is a somewhat random collection of scripts that I've written.
Most of these are either small enough or domain-specific enough not to
warrant their own repository.

In general, the shell scripts should work as-is on almost any Linux
system, and might work on other UNIX derivates.  Anything not written
in shell script has no dependencies outside of the standard library for
the language it is written in, unless otherwise noted.

Everything in this repository is licensed undeer a modified BSD license,

## secure-boot/
A couple of scripts to simplify setting up UEFI Secure Boot.  sb-init.sh
sets up a basic directory structure, copies out the current system
keys, and then generates new ones that can be used to sign things
locally. sb-install.sh must be run from Secure Boot Setup Mode,
and installs the keys generated by sb-init.sh alongside the ones it
copied out.  The general idea here is to circumvent Secure Boot while
still allowing usage of existing software (I wrote them so I could get
Linux booting under Secure Boot, and still boot Windows, and not have to
re-sign the Windows boot loader every time Windows decided to update it).

## unix/
A handful of scripts for UNIX like systems (mostly Linux), check the
README there for more info.

## windows
A couple of Windows specific scripts and registry files, check the README
there for more info.

## wfdps.py
This is a Python script for computing damage-per-second for weapons in
first-person shooters.  It was originally written with the stat system
from Warframe in mind, but it should work with only minor changes needed
for many other games (for example, it works perfectly for the games in
the Borderlands series).  Written mostly as a proof of concept, and to
show one of my friends how much of a small program is often dedicated
simply to control-flow logic and configuration parsing.
