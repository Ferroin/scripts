This is a somewhat random collection of scripts that I've written.
Most of these are either small enough or domain-specific enough not to
warrant their own repository.

In general, the shell scripts should work as-is on almost any Linux
system, and might work on other UNIX derivates.  Anything not written
in shell script has no dependencies outside of the standard library for
the language it is written in, unless otherwise noted.

Everything in this repository is licensed undeer a modified BSD license,
check LICENSE for details.

Here's a short list of what's here:
cp.sh           Simple script to copy a file.  Has a much smaller memory
                footprint than regular cp.
gen-ucode-cpio  A simple script to generate a microcode archive for Xen
                or Linux
getkeys.sh      Simple script to get keystrokes from a input device
                on Linux.  Needs 'input-events' from the input-tools
                package.
secure-boot     A couple of scripts to simplify setting up UEFI Secure Boot
win-reg         A couple of specific registry changes for Windows,
                check the README in that directory for specifics.
wfdps.py        A python script for computing weapon DPS for Warframe.
